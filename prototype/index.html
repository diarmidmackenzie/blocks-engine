<h1>A-Frame Tetris Games - Pre-alpha</h1>

<p>Pre-alpha development versions of some VR Tetris games.  Posted here to share with the A-Frame Dev community, but not ready for wider sharing yet.</p>

<p>Eventual target platform is Oculus Quest 2 (and in theory all other Web XR compatible devices, but Oculus Quest 2 is all I'm planning to test on).</p>

 <p>Controller support is still a work-in-progress.  So right now, games are only playable in a browser with an attached keyboard.</p>

 <p>Game modes available today:</p>

 <p><a href=2d-tetris.html>2D Tetris</a> - The classic game.<p>
 <p><a href=3d-tetris.html>3D Tetris</a> - A 3D version of Tetris.  Very hard to play using keyboard controls.  I'm hoping that adding Oculus controllers makes the rotation controls more intuitive.  The ability to inspect the play area from all sides should also make a big difference.</p>
 <p><a href=2d-pentris.html>2D "Pentris"</a> - Like classic 2D Tetris, but with all possible 5-block tiles.  This is much harder!  But with a bit of practice and familiarity with the new shapes, it's quite playable.  Being able to see the "next block" would be a big help - I'm working on it!</p>

 <p>All game modes use the same Javascript Engine, and the differences amount to a couple of lines of HTML.</p>
 <p>My hope is to make almost all aspects of the game customizable using HTML only.</p>
